# gatsby-starter-typescript-plus

> A starter kit for TypeScript-based Gatsby projects with sensible defaults.

This is a starter kit for [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) websites written in TypeScript. It includes the bare essentials for you to get started (styling, Markdown parsing, minimal toolset).

## Features

* TypeScript
* TSLint (with custom TSLint rules)
* Markdown rendering with Remark
* Basic component structure
* Styling with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)

## Geting started

Install this starter (assuming you have `gatsby-cli` installed) by running the following command:


```bash
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/resir014/gatsby-starter-typescript-plus
```

## Developing

A nodejs >= 6.0.0 setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8000
npm start

# build for production
npm run build

# build for production and push to gh-pages branch
npm run deploy
```

## Credits
