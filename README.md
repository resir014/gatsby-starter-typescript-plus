# gatsby-starter-typescript-plus

> A starter kit for TypeScript-based Gatsby projects with sensible defaults.

This is a starter kit for [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) websites written in TypeScript. It includes the bare essentials for you to get started (styling, Markdown parsing, minimal toolset).

## Features

- TypeScript
- ESLint (with custom ESLint rules)
- Markdown rendering with Remark
- Basic component structure
- Styling with [emotion](https://emotion.sh/)

## 🚀 Quick start

> A nodejs >= 6.0.0 setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

1. **Create a gatsby site using CLI**

Install `gatsby-cli` package globally on your machine.

```bash
# using NPM
npm install -g gatsby-cli

# using YARN
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

Use the `gatsby-cli` to create a new site and install its dependencies.

```bash
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/resir014/gatsby-starter-typescript-plus
```

2. **Start up development server.**

Move to project's directory.

```bash
cd project-name/
```

Start your site.

```bash
# using NPM
npm start

# using YARN
yarn start
```

Open source code using your favorite IDE/Text editor and navigate to `src/` directory, this is where your application live.

3. **Build your application for production.**

Once you're finished, you can make production build of your app using:

```bash
# using NPM
npm run build

# using YARN
yarn build
```

4. **Deploy your app to Github pages!**

After building your application in step 3, you're ready to publish your app and go online!

```bash
# using NPM
npm run deploy

# using YARN
yarn deploy
```
